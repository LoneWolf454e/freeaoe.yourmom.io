Alegreya is a libre (OFL) replacement for Copperplate Gothic, which is
originally used on the buttons and scenario titles/instructions. Another OFL
alternative would be Balthazar (by Dario Manuel Muhafara), which is technically
more similar to Copperplate Gothic, though I think Alegreya looks better.

The title font in the original AoE is apparently Castellar, which I can't find
a good, freely licensed alternative to. The titlefont used later seems to be
Trajan. Cinzel by Natanael Gama seems to be a good, freely licensed
alternative. The 'of' is probably Nuptial, I think Tangerine by Toshi Omagari
could replace it.

The fonts shipped on the CD is, according to dracoix on the Steam forums:
 - Centaur MT (v1.0)
 - Comic Sans MS (v5.11)
 - Georgia (v5.57)
 - Lucida Bright (v1.50)
 - Lucida Blackletter (v1.50)
 - Lucida Calligraphy (v1.60)
 - Papyrus (v1.0)
 - Poor Richard (v1.0)
 - Viner Hand ITC (v1.01)

In general, Arial seems to be used mostly everywhere.
